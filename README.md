# NLP Basics

# Step 1: Tokenization
# convert "the cat sat on the mat" to ["the", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat"]
# things that may need to be considered: upper vs lower case (Apple or apple), stops words ("the", "a", "of", etc), and typo correction ("gooood" or "good"

# Step 2: Build Dictionary
# ["the":1, "cat":2, "sat":3, "on":4, "the":5, "mat":6]
